# COVID-19 Expert Surveys

Starting in late February 2020, we have been conducting weekly surveys that asked a group of infectious disease modeling researchers to assess their collective expert opinion on the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US.

An expert was defined as a researcher who has spent a substantial amount of time in their professional career designing, building, and/or interpreting models to explain and understand infectious disease dynamics and/or the associated policy implications in human populations. 

We are working on a comprehensive write-up with methods and further analysis of individual-level responses.

A Word document showing the questions asked is available [here](listOfQuestions/ListOfQuestions.docx). A dataset with the "consensus distributions" combined across all experts for select questions is available [here](database/consensusForecastsDB).
